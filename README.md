# WanderIn

A social media application that brings the joy of exploration back into your travel itinerary.

- WanderIn allows users to post photos/short clips of their favorite places to sight-see, eat, connect, and everything in between.
- These locations may be popular or hidden gems. 
- Users can also browse others' posts and filter by location and type, so that they can plan for their next trip.
- Posts can then be saved into folders which can be organized in various ways.
